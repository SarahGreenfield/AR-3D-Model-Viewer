# AR-3D-Model-Viewer
My Project for my Master's Degree. 

## Description of the Project
This project is an Augmented Reality 3D Model Viewer. 
A working prototype of a potential application where a user can view their 3D model 
files (.obj, .stl, or .ply for example) either through virtual means or through AR means.
